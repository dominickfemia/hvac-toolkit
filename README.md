# HVAC Engineering Toolkit (Excel + ML)

A professional-grade Excel toolkit for HVAC and hydronic system design, built for engineers, designers, and interns. Includes calculators for duct, pipe, fan, and pump sizing, with an optional ML-based Darcy friction factor estimator trained on empirical data.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- 4-in-1 calculator suite: duct (rectangular, round, flat oval), pipe, fan, pump
- Friction factor toggle: Churchill approximation or ML (XGBoost regression)
- Validation UI: green/red/gray states with clear messages
- Protected & versioned Excel workbook
- Fully documented (PDF User Guide, Instructions tab, Version Log)

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works
- **Inputs:** flow rate, geometry, run length, surface roughness, fluid properties
- **Friction factor estimation:** Churchill (explicit) or ML (trained on Moody/Nikuradse data, ~600 points)
- **Core calculations:** velocity, Reynolds number, Darcyâ€“Weisbach, head/pressure loss
- **Outputs:** friction loss, horsepower, TDH, velocity
- **Validation:** range checks with color-coded messages

## ðŸ“Š Methods & Validation
- **Colebrookâ€“White equation (reference)**
- **Churchill approximation (implemented)**
- **ML (XGBoost)** trained on digitized Moody/Nikuradse data
- Accuracy: RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.96, RMSE â‰ˆ 0.0025
