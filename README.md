# HVAC Engineering Toolkit (Excel + ML)

This repository contains the **engineering backbone** behind my HVAC Toolkit:
- Code to train an **XGBoost** surrogate for Darcy friction factor and export a dense **(Re, Îµ/D) â†’ f** lookup grid.
- Concise method/integration notes for using the grid in Excel.
- Tiny tests and sample data to verify the export.

> ðŸ“Œ **Deliberate split:** This repo omits the Excel workbook and full visual/narrative.  
> For the complete case study (screenshots, worked examples, validation story), see **Portfolio:** https://gomechra.com

## What this repo includes
- `ml/` XGBoost training + grid export
- `docs/` terse method & Excel integration specs
- `data/` tiny sample points + (generated) grid
- `tests/` smoke tests for sanity

## What this repo intentionally omits
- The Excel workbook (`*.xlsm`) and high-res screenshots
- Large/raw datasets

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1) create & activate a virtual env
python -m venv .venv
# mac/linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# windows (powershell):
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2) install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) export the lookup grid (writes data/processed/grid_f_lookup.csv)
python ml/train_and_export.py --out data/processed/grid_f_lookup.csv

# 4) run tests
pytest -q
